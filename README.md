# Learning from mistakes of other ecosystems: Securing ink! smart contracts from the beginning

In this tech talk, we will share valuable knowledge and best practices with builders of ink! Smart Contracts about how to approach security during development. At Oak Security, we have performed more than 350 security audits across ecosystems, of which more than 100 were of Rust-based Wasm smart contracts. 

We will cover best practices for developing secure smart contracts, provide insights into common vulnerabilities in Rust-based Wasm smart contracts, and share our perspective on what teams can do to incorporate security into their product lifecycle from the beginning. We will discuss the “shift left security” paradigm and its importance in crypto security.

We believe this tech talk will provide attendees with practical tools and a stronger understanding of security in the ever-changing crypto ecosystem, empowering them to prevent becoming the next exploited crypto project.
